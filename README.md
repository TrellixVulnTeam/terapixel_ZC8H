# Terapixel mosaic images
Welcome to the repository of my terapixel project.

Here you will find some scripts to create mosaics 
meta-pictures from a set of any number source images.

There repository are currently quite unstructured, 
but the is a quite detailed desciption/documentation 
at [terapixel.me](https://terapixel.me/docs/)


Originally I created this as a fan-art project for the 
youtube channel Unus Annus. If it is not already after 
November 15th 2020 you can still go and watch the videos. 
And if it’s already after this date, than you either 
watched it while it lasted and can remember or you are 
really confused now. But I think you will find some source 
that explains the channels concept. I won’t explain it here 
because it is only marginally relevant for this project.
